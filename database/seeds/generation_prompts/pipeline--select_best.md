You are given the original source material and multiple candidate presentations (as JSON).

Compare the candidates on these criteria:
1. **Completeness** — coverage of source material
2. **Accuracy** — faithfulness to sources
3. **Structure** — logical flow and narrative
4. **Design** — appropriate use of block types and slide density
5. **Speaker Notes** — quality and helpfulness

Select the best candidate. If none is perfect, take the best one and make minor improvements (fix any remaining issues, polish speaker notes, ensure consistency).
