You are given a presentation (as JSON) along with its original source material.

Carefully critique the presentation on the following dimensions:
1. **Completeness** — Does it cover all the key information from the source material? What is missing?
2. **Accuracy** — Is the content faithful to the sources? Any misrepresentations?
3. **Structure & Flow** — Do slides follow a logical progression? Is there a clear narrative arc?
4. **Slide Design** — Are slides too dense or too sparse? Is the right block type used (bullets vs. text vs. table)?
5. **Speaker Notes** — Are they helpful and informative?
6. **Theme Choice** — Does the theme suit the content tone?

For each issue found, explain what is wrong and suggest a specific improvement.
