Read the code, the .md douments in all packages, @PROJECT_PROMPT.md, and the manual. 
Look at the current changes ("git status" etc.). 
What is missing in the douments? Consider what is needed in each of them.
Update them and take the style of each document into account. For instance, keep the manual brief and to the point.
